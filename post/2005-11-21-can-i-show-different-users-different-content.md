  Within limits. The Mambo User Manager currently only supports a few
  levels (&quot;groups&quot;) of users. You can show different content to different
  groups, but you cannot show each individual user a unique set of
  content. Put another way, every user in the group will see the same
  content as the other users in the group. If you really need this
  functionality, there are some third party components which add
  additional flexibility.<br />
