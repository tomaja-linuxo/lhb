  PHP 5.0.0 Released!<br />
  <br />

  <br />
  Some of the key features of PHP 5 include:<br />
  <br />
  * The Zend Engine II with a new object model and dozens of new features.<br />
  * XML support has been completely redone in PHP 5, all extensions are now focused around the excellent libxml2 library (http://www.xmlsoft.org/).<br />
  * A new SimpleXML extension for easily accessing and manipulating XML as PHP objects. It can also interface with the DOM extension and vice-versa.<br />
  * A brand new built-in SOAP extension for interoperability with Web Services.<br />
  * A new MySQL extension named MySQLi for developers using MySQL 4.1 and later. This new extension includes an object-oriented interface in addition to a traditional interface; as well as support for many of MySQL's new features, such as prepared statements.<br />
  * SQLite has been bundled with PHP. For more information on SQLite, please visit their website.<br />
  * Streams have been greatly improved, including the ability to access low-level socket operations on streams.<br />
