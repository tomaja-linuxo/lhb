IT managers know that automated systems offer a quicker payback and more reliability than manually managed backup. The SuperLoader utilizes a Drive Carrier Assembly (DCA) that enables the end-user to simply upgrade the SuperLoader from one like-technology to another (DLT1 to Super DLTtape technology) to increase performance as backup needs grow and the ability to scale from 8 to 16 slots. It also offers Web based management tools, to monitor, configure, and diagnose the system from any location. 

The SuperLoader works with all leading backup and recovery software, including CA ARCServe, Veritas BackupExec and NetBackup, and Legato Networker. Orders are being received as of April 15, with shipments beginning April 22.
