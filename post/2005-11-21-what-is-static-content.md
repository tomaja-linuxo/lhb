  Static Content is simply a content item which is not part of a Section
  or a Category. Static Content cannot be added to a Blog, a Section or a
  Category. Static Content is, in other words, an independent, stand alone
  page. Static Content pages can be created, edited and deleted in the
  Static Content Manager. In the sample content you have installed with
  Mambo, the Main Menu choice &quot;The Mambo License&quot; shows an example of a
  Static Content page.
